\section{INTRODUCTION} 
This report seeks to investigate tensor operations carried out on rank 3 tensors. The rank 2 tensors procedures and the pseudocode required to achieve the procedures are presented. Using the basis of rank 2 tensors, rank 3 tensor operations are demonstrated along with pseudocode implementation. Each of the procedures is further implemented using C++ from the basis of the pseudocode.  
\section{2D TENSOR ADD}
The addition of two 2-dimensional tensors is congruent to 2 dimensional matrices. This therefore requires using element-by-element addition, as shown in Equation \ref{2d-add-eqn}. Algorithm 1 displays the pseudo-code used to calculate the addition of two N$\times$N matrices.

\begin{align}
C_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij} \label{2d-add-eqn}
\end{align}

\section{2D TENSOR MULTIPLY}
The multiplication of rank 2 tensors is equivalent to 2-dimensional matrix multiplication which is achieved by performing the dot product on the respective
rows and columns, as illustrated in Equation \ref{2d-mult-eqn}. Algorithm 2 shows the pseudo-code used to multiply two N$\times$N matrices.
\begin{align}
C_{ij} = \sum_{k} A_{ij} \times B_{ij} \label{2d-mult-eqn}
\end{align}

\section{3D TENSOR ADD}
Using the rank 2 tensors as a basis, when a third rank is added the addition follows the same procedure, however the additional rank corresponds to an additional vertex of summation. The addition is achieved using element-by-element addition, similar to a 2D array. The difference is only the inclusion of the additional dimension. Algorithm 3 shows the pseudo-code used to sum two N$\times$N$\times$N matrices.

\section{3D TENSOR MULTIPLY}
The multiplication of two 3-dimensional arrays makes use of 2-dimensional matrix multiplication as a basis. The $\text{i}^\text{th}$row-plane of array A and the $\text{j}^\text{th}$ column-plane of array B are multiplied using traditional 2-dimensional matrix multiplication shown in Algorithm \ref{2d-mult-eqn}. The result is the $\text{k}^\text{th}$ layer-plane of array C. Algorithm 4 shows the pseudo-code used to multiply two N$\times$N$\times$N matrices. This can be visualised as is seen in figure \ref{3D}

\section{IMPLEMENTATION}
The preceding sections' pseudocode is implemented using c++. The code generated performs as detailed by the pseudocode and is accessible via the public github link \url{https://github.com/IsabelTollman/ELEN4020A_Group7/tree/Code} under the `\emph{Code}' branch.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}
The formation of rank 3 tensor operations is based on the rules of rank 2 tensors, with the addition of the multiple iterations present in the additional dimension.
